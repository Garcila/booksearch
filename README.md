# Google Books Search

### Overview

In this activity, you'll see a new React-based Google Books Search app. 
This project requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. 
You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

The book search should have each of the following fields:

* `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API

* `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

* `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

* `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

* `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API

* Creating `documents` in your `books` collection similar to the following:
